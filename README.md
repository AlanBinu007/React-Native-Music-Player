# React Native Audio Player ðŸŽ¶

An example audio player app for [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/), built with [Expo](https://expo.io/). This codebase was heavily inspired by the [open-source](https://github.com/expo/playlist-example) playlist example app written by [Greg Kufera](https://github.com/gkufera).
